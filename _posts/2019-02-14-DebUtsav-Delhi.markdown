DebConf is the annual Debian conference which is held in a different country every year. DebConf18 was held in Hsinchu, Taiwan, from July 29 to August 5, 2018. MiniDebConfs are local meetings organized by Debian project members to achieve similar objectives to those of the DebConf, but on a regional context. When majority of talks are not Debian specific, it is called DebUtsav - celebration of Free Software by Debian community. DebUtsav Delhi will be happening on 9th and 10th March. Venue will soon be announced on the website. You are invited to attend the event and participate in all the sessions you like, attendance is FREE of cost.
