“Drupal Camp Delhi” aka DCD is the largest watering hole for the Drupal community in North India, and the most frequently held Drupal event across the country. It brings together the Drupal developer and business user community.

For developers, the event presents opportunities for learning, getting involved in community contributions via code/ review/ QA sprints for Drupal 7 and Drupal 8, and even find potential employers.

For the business community there is an opportunity for learning from presentations made on case studies of Drupal websites, meeting representatives of the leading Drupal companies in India, and some of the brightest individuals working on Drupal in the country. Their experience at DCD will help them leverage the technology and resources available to build amazing digital platforms for their customers. Strong Drupal partnerships are also forged during such events. Companies can also look forward to hiring their next batch of freshers/interns who already pre-trained/experienced in Drupal.
