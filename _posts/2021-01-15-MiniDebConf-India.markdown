Debian India is a group of enthusiasts who would like to expand the Debian community in the sub-continent and thus to increase the number of active contributors to the project. With the mission of spreading the spirit of the Debian project, we are organizing an event which not only caters the English speaking community but also those who can understand Hindi, Malayalam or Telugu. We can also add more languages according to the availability of slots/speakers/volunteers in that particular language. This multi-lingual MiniDebConf is inspired from the sub-tracks in DebConf 20 as well as the MiniDebConf Brazil 2020. Thanks for joining us and all your support! Keep loving Debianâ€¦
