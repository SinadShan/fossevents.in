We are happy to announce the first-ever Drupal Camp in Chennai organized by the Drupal Chennai Community. Drupal Camp Chennai 2019 is a conference organized for the Drupal community and people showing interest in Drupal. This two-day event features training workshops and sessions. It will be held on 7th and 8th December 2019 in IIT Madras.

The Drupal Camp is not only about the conference, the sessions and the informal gatherings (BOFs) but also about bonding with an array of energetic and passionate people. After all, you come to Drupal for the code and stay for the community.

The conference programme has been arranged to suit both completely new and advanced developers.

During the conference, speakers will deliver their lectures in English and native-languages of South India like Tamil, Malayalam, and Telugu.

Spend your weekend with a wonderful community which collaborates, networks, connects, and shares. The community that is Drupal is truly exceptional.
