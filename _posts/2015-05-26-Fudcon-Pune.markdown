FUDCon is the Fedora Users and Developers Conference, a major free software event held in various regions around the world, usually annually per region.

FUDCon is a mix of sessions. There are talks that range from technology introductions to deep dives, hands-on workshops, BoFs where like-minded people get together to discuss a project or technology and hackfests where contributors work on specific initiatives. Topics include infrastructure, feature development, community building, general management and governance, marketing, testing and QA, packaging, etc.

FUDCon is always free to attend for anyone in the world.
