Go is an open source project developed by a team at Google and many contributors from the open source community.

Go makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

This conference is brought to you by the Go Language Community in India together with the Emerging Technology Trust (ETT). ETT is a non-profit organization, established to organize and conduct technology conferences in India. It's current portfolio includes DeccanRuby Conf, DevOpsDays India, GopherCon India and RubyConf India.

We love going to conferences that don't make you choose between two great presentations. So we created GopherConIndia as a single-track event that you don't want to miss and where everyone gets the opportunity to see the same talks. We think you'll enjoy the speakers we're lining up so much, you won't want to miss anyone of them. Friday and Saturday will offer full days of conference sessions.

Note: The conference is entirely in English.
