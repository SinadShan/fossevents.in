Debian is the Universal Operating System of the users, by the users, for the users.”

DebConf is the annual Debian conference which is held in a different country every year. DebConf18 was held in Hsinchu, Taiwan, from July 29 to August 5, 2018.

MiniDebConfs are local meetings organized by Debian project members to achieve similar objectives to those of the DebConf, but on a regional context.

When majority of talks are not Debian specific, it is called DebUtsav - celebration of Free Software by Debian community.
