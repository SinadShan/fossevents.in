Kubernetes Forums connect international and local cloud native experts, adopters, developers, and end users in global cities to enable face-to-face collaboration and deliver rich educational experiences. Engage with the leaders of Kubernetes and other CNCF-hosted projects as we set the direction for the cloud native ecosystem. Kubernetes Forums have both a beginner and an advanced track; about half of the speakers are international experts and half are from the local area.
